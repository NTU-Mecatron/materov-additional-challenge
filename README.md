# Brittle Star Detection with YOLO

## Overview

This repository contains the resources needed to train YOLO models for detecting brittle stars. Developed by [Mecatron](https://mecatron.sg/), this project is part of the 2024 OER MATE ROV Ocean Exploration Video Challenge.

## Repository Contents

- **`train.py`**: Script for training the YOLO model.
- **`train_config.yaml`**: Configuration file for training parameters used in `train.py`.
- **`predict.py`**: Script for running predictions using the trained model.
- **`predict_config.yaml`**: Configuration file for prediction settings used in `predict.py`.
- **`convert_spreadsheet.py`**: Utility script for converting data from spreadsheets into the required format for training and prediction.

## Tutorials

- **[Setup Guide](docs/installation.md):** Step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment and dependencies.
- **[Model Training & Prediction Guide](docs/model_training_and_prediction.md):** Detailed guide on training the model and making predictions.
